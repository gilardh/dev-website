## About Komodo Platform   {#formats}

### Plateform Overview

**Komodo Platform Overview**

After years of innovation and development, Komodo's multi-chain architecture overcomes the challenges faced by other smart-contract platforms.

The philosophy behind Komodo's multi-chain architecture relies on four pillars.

- Security
- Scalability
- Interoperability
- Adaptability

With these four pillars in place, users of all types will find powerful, customizable solutions that will set your blockchain creativity free.

**Security**
**Enjoy the Protection of the Bitcoin Hash Rate**
Secure your project with the power of the Bitcoin network via Komodo’s delayed proof of work security mechanism. Don’t waste time worrying about attackers.

- Approximately every half hour, a hash of the developers blockchain is notarized to Bitcoin
- All transactions included in the hash are considered to have achieved finality
- For the consensus mechanism, arbitrarily choose between a mixture of Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake

**Scalability**
**Have a Blockchain All To Yourself. Want More Than One? No Problem.**
Developers and their users have a full Smart Chain all to themselves, and can combine any number of Smart Chains together into one cluster.

- Developers and their users can securely own a full Smart Chain
- Each Smart Chain is completely autonomous
- If your project grows beyond the capacity of a single chain, simply add more
- Scale your maximum transaction-per-second throughput into the millions, if desired
- No gas fees. All transaction fees are paid in your Smart Chain’s coin

**Interoperability**
**Link Your Smart Chain to Other Chains**
Your project is interoperable with all others in the Komodo ecosystem, plus connected with over 99% of coins and tokens through Komodo’s industry-leading atomic-swap technology.

- Komodo’s Multi-Chain Syncing feature allows you to scale out linearly on demand
- Smart Chains can verify and update local state based on the activity of compatible Smart Chains
- Transfer assets and tokens between compatible Smart Chains
- Use Komodo's atomic-swap DEX software to trade your Smart Chain assets with Non-Smart assets.

**Adaptability**
**Develop Your Smart Chain at Will**
Adapt your blockchain to create a purpose-built solution that fits your individual needs. Receive all new features developed by Komodo to ensure your project is future-proofed.

- Twenty-four different launch parameters are available to customize the functionality of your Smart Chain
- Rely on the Antara framework to fully customize your Smart Chain with unique and arbitrary code within the consensus mechanism
- Share and adopt code in Komodo's open-source community
- Dispose of Smart Chains that become data-weight heavy, or transfer them to fresh Smart Chains for ease of use
- No need for a virtual machine (VM) nor a VM-based programming language

**Together, the Komodo Platform is Unlike Anything Else**
With the Komodo architecture at your command, you are prepared to lift your Smart Chain software to levels never before seen in the blockchain industry.

**Komodo's White-Label Software Brings Your Innovation to Market Faster**
The Komodo Platform offers many free white-label applications that can help you bring your innovation to market faster.

- Atomic-Swap Decentralized Exchange & Multi-Asset Wallet
- Decentralized-Crowdfunding App
- Custom Block Explorers
- SPV Electrum Server Integration
- Core Antara Modules

**Installing, Using, and Testing Komodo Software is Free**
The best way to learn about Komodo is to use it for yourself.
